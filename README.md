"I’ll See You in the Sky" simulates the color of the sky base on your location (city's name) input, creating a quiet little corner on the Interweb. "I’ll See You in the Sky" invites you to choose where to go so we can watch the color of the sky together. and just breath.

The website has only one page. It prompts the user for the location input by the city’s name.
When a user inputs the correct city’s name (case-insensitive), it will return the current weather and time information of that city, using OpenWeather’s API.

On the homepage, there is an input field “Where would you like to go?”, where you can input your desired city.
The background of the landing page is an animated gradient color of the “all” the colors of the sky.

Upon entering the correct city’s name, simply hit the enter key,
the website will return a stimulating color of the sky of that city based on the current weather temperature,
weather conditions (rain, snow, cloudy, drizzle, thunderstorm), and the current time. From there, the user can input other city’s name,
and the site will return the gradient color of that city’s sky. Simply refresh to get to the page landing again.
If the user enters an incorrect city’s name into the input field, the site will stay on the landing page.

When hovering over the hallowed circle on the bottom right corner, it will display the description and concept of the site.
When the user is on a city's page, the hallowed circle will display that city’s current temperature, weather condition, and time.

The site is designed to be as minimal as possible, where the focus should just be on the color.
The colors may not be scientifically accurate, but they are truthful.
The site aims to create a quiet little corner on the Interweb :)
